// 1. Suppose that we wanted to create a browser-based calendar program for keeping track of things. In comments, list at least three reasonable abstractions that you might use to build this program; for each abstraction, list out at least two properties and behaviors that it would make sense for that abstraction to have. Below is an example - please write your answer in the same format.
  // 'Car'
  // Description: Our app manages car sales.
  // Every 'car' has
  // - a make
  // - a model
  // - a year
  // Every 'car' can
  // - drive
  // - brake
  // - park

// Answer Starts Here

/*
'Event'
Description: Our app is a calendar program
Every 'Event' has
- a start time
- an end time
- a location
- a subject
- participants
Every 'Event' can
- be created
- be deleted
- be shared
- be moved
- repeat
*/

// Answer Ends Here


// 2. Create an Object literal that lines up with the following description. Store it in the variable 'pet_owner', below. Be sure to give it reasonable values for each of its properties.

  // 'Owner'
  // Description: We are making an app for a veterinary clinic - it manages pets' vaccinations.
  // Every 'owner' has:
  // - a name
  // - an address

var pet_owner;

// Answer Starts Here
var pet_owner = {
  name: "Cheng",
  address: "1234 Candycane Lane, Turkeydom, ThanksA"
}
// Answer Ends Here


// 3. Create an Object literal that lines up with the following description. Store it in the variable `some_pet`, below.

  // Pet
  // Description: We are making an app for a veterinary clinic - it manages pets' vaccinations.
  // Every 'pet' has:
  // - a name
  // - a species
  // - a breed
  // - a noise that it can make (e.g. 'bark', 'meow', etc.)
  // Every pet can:
  // - make noise (each pet makes its own unique noise, as specified by `noise`.

var some_pet;

// Answer Starts Here
var some_pet = {
  name: "Sparky",
  species: "Dog",
  breed: "Scottish Terrier",
  sound: "Woof",
  makeSound: function() {
    console.log(some_pet.sound)
  }
}
