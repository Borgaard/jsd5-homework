/*
    When programming user interfaces, you will often need to display results based on a certain input. In this exercise, help the students design
    a program that will let users know what legal privileges U.S. citizens enjoy based on their age.

    Write a program that outputs results based on usersâ€™ age. This exercise draws on if/else statements, Boolean logic, and comparison operators. 
    See the conditions below:

    - If you are under 16, you cannot do much outside of going to school
    - If you are 16 or older, you can drive
     - If you 18 or older, you can vote
    - If you are 21 or older, you can drink alcohol
    - If you are 25 or older, you can rent a car
                    - If you are 35 or older, you can run for president
                        - If you are 62 or older, you collect social security benefits

    The results that your program provides should be only the most recent privilege based on the provided age.

// Function that displays privilege you receive based on your agePrivilege
function agePrivilege(age){
    
    if(age >= 62){
        console.log('you collect social security benefits');
    }else if(age >= 35) {
        console.log('you can run for president');
    }else if (age >= 25){
        console.log('you can rent a car');
    }else if (age >= 21){
        console.log('you can drink alcohol');
    }else if(age >= 18){
        console.log('you can vote');
    }else if (age >= 16){
        console.log('you can drive');
    }
