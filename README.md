How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```jsd5-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```jsd5-homework/Sasha-svodnik```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's github name. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory. Example for homework #2: `jsd5-homework/Sasha-svodnik/hw_2/hubot.js`
