## Homework (due Tuesday 11/22)
Finish your Slack bot
* Create a new GitHub repo for your bot, including:
   * the JS code for your bot
   * a readme file that documents what your bot is capable of and how to interact with it
* Push your code to your repo, then send Nicole a link to the repo on Slack

Because the Slack bot code will not be part of our regular homework repo, Nicole will instead DM (direct message) you on Slack with feedback on your code.
